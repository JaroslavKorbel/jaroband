<p>I wanna know what goes on<br>
when the curtains are pulled.<br>
I hope it's what I think,<br>
I hope I know what's below.</p>
<p>We are created, destinated, all the same.</p>
<p>Who would have said<br>
that I deserve<br>
all the credit that you give.<br>
We both know we know nothing,<br>
we are both yet unexposed.</p>
<p>Juliet, where are you now?<br>
Is the meaning so lost?<br>
Are you the proclaimed holy light?</p>
<p>During the nights<br>
fighting all sorts of fights,<br>
pushing away from the sights,<br>
using a fair-trade disguise.</p>
<p>All the details of all yourself, everything<br>
you never wanted to reveal.<br>
I was wrong to think it's real.<br>
Now you're on it again.</p>
<p>I thought I saw a shooting star.<br>
The more I know, the less you are.<br>
You try to stay on track,<br>
but under pressure you tend to crack.<br>
I'm seeing double.</p>
<p>Tiptoeing around the topics of<br>
the future, past and present.<br>
All important things<br>
are never to be found.<br>
You'll never find them.</p>
<p>You tell and sell forgotten dreams<br>
to the people with no means.<br>
It is almost like I see myself.<br>
I'm a stunt double.</p>
<p>Disillusioned JÃ¶tunheim,<br>
so many faces you hide behind.<br>
But you won't fool the thunderstorms.</p>
<p>During the nights<br>
fighting all sorts of fights,<br>
pushing away from the sights,<br>
using a fair-trade disguise.</p>
<p>All the details of all yourself, everything<br>
you never wanted to reveal.<br>
I was wrong to think it's real.<br>
Now you're on it again.</p>
