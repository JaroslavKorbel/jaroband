<p>Don't blink, unrelenting speculations circulating.<br>
A single image reappearing,<br>
and it's not looking like it is soon to leave.</p>
<p>All the more I<br>
started advancing towards imminent self-destruction.<br>
After I feel creeping it up, crawling it up my<br>
spine and my stomach is in vortex of delusion.<br>
All it takes is no more than a second<br>
to trigger response.</p>
<p>I plunge into a state of misery,<br>
forgone dilemmas, attempts at plain prosperity.<br>
Caught in a trap I built for you,<br>
created a gap for me to fall through.</p>
<p>You know what I'm thinking?<br>
I think I can't choose because you are holding me back.<br>
Now I'm on the crossroads,<br>
this time I know which way's the wrong one.</p>
<p>The issue is that the two in front are rotten<br>
and I'm not really feeling like losing two years.<br>
It just follows, it never quits<br>
until you cut it off.</p>
<p>But never is time,<br>
the right moment for it doesn't just appear.<br>
It is there and we cannot grasp it.<br>
And you wait, and then it's gone for a while.</p>
<p>Until it improves and makes a comeback.<br>
Then all you can do is regret.</p>
<p>I plunge into a state of misery,<br>
calling off the questions.<br>
Forgone dilemmas, attempts at plain prosperity.<br>
Caught in a trap I built for you,<br>
it's just me, waiting to contribute.</p>
<p>And it is I.</p>
