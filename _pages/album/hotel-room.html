<p>We took the keys and let the visions bloom.<br>
We made it ours, our little hotel room.<br>
Heavy door and golden handles.<br>
Picture frames and bright-eyed candles.</p>
<p>Why did it seem so distant?<br>
When we could've had anything in an instant?<br>
Slow roll, overgrown.<br>
You hit the note and you know<br>
I can't resist the eyes on you.</p>
<p>Tell me more,<br>
tell me.<br>
How'd you like<br>
to sail the oceans blue?</p>
<p>Tell me more,<br>
tell me.<br>
How'd you like<br>
to set the oceans' moon?</p>
<p>The phantoms reappear<br>
on the other side,<br>
as we adhere.<br>
All of our platonic fears are gone.</p>
<p>Successors to our dreams,<br>
doubts and minefields.<br>
Undisturbed forever it seems.</p>
<p>Distorted perspective,<br>
commencing reflective criticism<br>
of your worn-out stance.</p>
<p>Hiding in the details, so cosy.<br>
You warm up, and let them out.<br>
All the words of wisdom, Pandora's box.<br>
And what for, Epimetheus?</p>
<p>You decide your future,<br>
it's in the palm of your hand.<br>
So describe it clearly,<br>
tell me.</p>
<p>Tell me more,<br>
tell me.<br>
How'd you like<br>
to sail the oceans blue?</p>
<p>Just cave in, and save me<br>
from all the grief's monsoon.</p>
<p>We are a part of this anthropogenesis.<br>
Hear my voice now.<br>
A single entity,<br>
wrapped in a sea.</p>
