<p>Downtown struggle, former troublemakers on the loose.<br>
Underwhelming, out of focus, we cannot choose.<br>
Cleaning after golden boys.<br>
The hardest part is to begin.</p>
<p>The thieves are out again.<br>
Noticing a trend.<br>
Finding a clue.<br>
To help us cut through.</p>
<p>Clothes off.</p>
<p>Burglar in the afternoon.<br>
Torturing self for a tune.<br>
Reading up on the news.<br>
They kill.<br>
Getting lost in own abuse.</p>
<p>Realize your own demise.<br>
Finding a clue to help us fall through.</p>
<p>Having a deja-vu.<br>
You've heard this too.<br>
Being this much obsessed<br>
makes it feel so processed.<br>
You are so processed.</p>
<p>Clearly I am mesmerized,<br>
why are you so much surprised?<br>
If you would know the lines,<br>
you wouldn't have to.</p>
