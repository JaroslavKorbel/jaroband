<p>All your past insignificances that lead up to now<br>
are the sources of corrupted lateral thinking<br>
and I try to hide them away<br>
from all the deliberate<br>
thieving of happiness I construct in myself.</p>
<p>On and on.</p>
<p>Because we&#39;re stooges<br>
of the cruellest of them all.<br>
As we project our fear on the canvas of fears.</p>
<p>Stooges,<br>
blessed fools test<br>
all the strengths of<br>
the strongest knots<br>
just to safe-way their hope.</p>
<p>Sturdy foundations,<br>
I found it interesting<br>
that our views polarized<br>
in three hundred sixty five days<br>
since your eyes glazed<br>
as they met mine.</p>
<p>Long gone are those doubts and sad presages.<br>
Every book&#39;s chapters have passages<br>
the readers would rather skip<br>
and never find out.</p>
<p>But who are they to think<br>
that only they&#39;re right,<br>
nobody stumbles and everyone might<br>
just about be perfect the way they are.</p>
<p>All of our thoughts.</p>
<p>Because we&#39;re stooges<br>
of the cruellest of them all.<br>
As we project our fears<br>
on the canvas of fears.</p>
<p>Oh we&#39;re stooges,<br>
blessed fools test<br>
all the strengths of<br>
the strongest knots<br>
just to safe-way their hope.</p>
<p>All of our thoughts.</p>
