<p>Steady and patient,<br>
flowing like the river,<br>
we were drifting.</p>
<p>Awoke amidst of<br>
the coldest days of autumn,<br>
falling leaves.</p>
<p>The forces behind us orchestrate.<br>
The forces, they bind us,<br>
construct our fates.</p>
<p>Decay fortifies us.<br>
Precise, always like clockwork.</p>
<p>Our wings are almost mended now.</p>
<p>You knew what I was about to do.<br>
You know me better.<br>
I am Enkidu.</p>
<p>Distance leaves me spanning to despair.<br>
A second away, yet you let me.<br>
Let me bear it all.</p>
<p>You see through the conniptions.<br>
You remind me of prescriptions.<br>
All I see are distant lights in<br>
towns and cities that are fighting<br>
over non-existent immunities.</p>
<p>The forces behind us, they orchestrate.<br>
The forces, they bind us, construct our fates.<br>
Decay fortifies us, filling out the strays.<br>
Precise, always like clockwork in the tower.</p>
<p>Our wings are almost mended<br>
now that we know how it goes.</p>
