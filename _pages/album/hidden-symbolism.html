<p>Whose opinions differ is a fool.<br>
Telling it, yelling it, screaming, shouting, everything is cruel.</p>
<p>It's the one thing that you missed, now it's haunting you.</p>
<p>Stretching far the outer layer, lies in lairs, watching,<br>
waiting for you, know it's coming.</p>
<p>You won't stop the bricks, clock ticks out, you run inside, terrified.<br>
Stolen, hiding from the event horizon. No use in trying.</p>
<p>And you crawl in fear that the worst is near,<br>
yet you wanna know. You won't take no placebo.</p>
<p>Never should've asked. If I knew I'd pass.<br>
All the things to forget, every moment, every step.</p>
<p>There's no going back,<br>
no going back down the track.<br>
Do yourself a favour,<br>
make a wish and cut the cord.</p>
<p>It all seems natural,<br>
the way it comes is pitiful.</p>
<p>I never thought of it.</p>
<p>Drag, drag, listen up,<br>
it's on my mind a lot.<br>
When I see, when I sense,<br>
it kicks me, it's immense.</p>
<p>I know, I know I asked,<br>
it's not a test,<br>
I thought you're something more.<br>
I thought you're something more than me.</p>
<p>But you are only just like me.</p>
