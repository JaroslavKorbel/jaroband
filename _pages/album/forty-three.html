<p>Green, white, red, a coat of arms.<br>
As many said, low-born collide with pure-bred.<br>
The two love birds on their quest to clasp the city south by<br>
west, by north, by south, by east, my knees are weak.</p>
<p>Economy of death reeks of bloody breath.<br>
Narcotics to fuel the dreams. Premonitions of light beams.<br>
Seeing, not knowing. Being controlling.<br>
Signs on the walls. Slowly it crawls.</p>
<p>The forty three for the whole world to see.<br>
Cast into dust. Missing suddenly.<br>
Thousands before and more to be.<br>
Unending slavery to bring unity.</p>
<p>No responses from the saints,<br>
too busy not making claims.<br>
Liberty of expression<br>
will make you a connection.</p>
<p>Steel plates in their heads.<br>
Raining oil, soaking wet.<br>
Blazing surface as they set.<br>
Thoughts are leaving for their beds.</p>
<p>And I see wisdom in foolishness.<br>
I plead guilty to indifferences.<br>
To know and stand unconditionally.<br>
To be a part of the forty three.</p>
<p>Standing so close to me.<br>
But I can barely see through the Coventry.<br>
As thousands before and more to follow<br>
fight for the freedom against a grave too shallow.</p>
<p>By west, by north, by south, by east.<br>
Overlook the cities from afar.<br>
See the people from afar.<br>
By west, by south, by north,<br>
my knees are weak.</p>
